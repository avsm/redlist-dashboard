/**
 * fetch-col-checklist (#271, Phase 3): download the CURATED Catalogue of Life
 * Checklist (ChecklistBank dataset `3LR`) as an EXTENDED ColDP archive and extract
 * NameUsage.tsv — the input to build-backbone's demotion overlay.
 *
 * Why: our species universe is built from the CoL eXtended Release (XR, see
 * fetch-col-xr), which maximizes coverage but does NOT reconcile conflicting source
 * taxonomies — so it over-splits, surfacing contested splits as accepted species
 * that become spurious "Not Evaluated" rows (e.g. Pycnonotus tricolor, an accepted
 * species in XR but a synonym of the assessed P. barbatus in the curated checklist).
 * The curated checklist applies CoL's editorial reconciliation. We use it as a
 * CORRECTION OVERLAY, not the base: build-backbone drops from the XR universe any
 * col_id the curated checklist DEMOTES (to synonym/infraspecific). Curated silence
 * never deletes coverage (so groups XR has but the checklist lacks — e.g. macroalgae,
 * whose AlgaeBase GSD isn't in the curated assembly — are preserved); only curated
 * contradiction does. col_ids are shared across both datasets, so the join is exact
 * WHERE BOTH CARRY THE USAGE — but the release is NOT a subset of the XR: 94,728 of
 * its 5.4M usages have no XR row (measured, COL26.6 XR vs 3LR). Harmless for
 * demotion, which only ever removes; it does mean anything keyed off an XR row
 * cannot see those usages (see build-backbone's in_checklist).
 *
 * We only need col:ID/status/rank/scientificName, which the smaller SIMPLE archive
 * (~166MB vs ~1.8GB extended) also carries — but ChecklistBank only serves a GET
 * export.zip if that exact archive is already pre-built, and won't build one on
 * demand for anonymous requests (a fresh build needs a token we don't have). The
 * extended archive is the better bet of the two — the simple one has lagged the
 * extended one by days on every release we have watched — so this always asks for
 * extended. `3LR` is the rolling latest CoL release, swappable via env
 * COL_CHECKLIST_DATASET.
 *
 * NEITHER archive is guaranteed to exist when `3LR` moves, which is why
 * resolveChecklistDataset() steps back a release rather than trusting the alias.
 * `3LR` starts pointing at a new release the day CoL publishes it, but the export
 * build is a separate job that runs whenever it runs: COL26.8's archives appeared
 * one day after its release, COL26.7's after three, and COL26.9 had none at all
 * four days in — which is what broke the 2026-09-13 weekly sync, the second
 * rollover failure here after COL26.7's. Since the alias moves first and the
 * archive follows, every monthly rollover opens a window where the newest curated
 * release cannot be downloaded at all.
 *
 * Downloads to a TEMP dir (outside data/) so the TSV is never swept into the R2
 * upload; build-backbone reads it, then the sync removes the temp dir.
 *
 * Returns the path to the extracted NameUsage.tsv.
 *
 *   npx tsx scripts/fetch-col-checklist.ts        # downloads + prints the TSV path

/**
 * Resolve the alias to the concrete release behind it — and to one we can download.
 *
 * `3LR` is a MOVING pointer — it was COL26.6 in June and is COL26.9 now — while
 * the XR pin follows GBIF's occurrence index and moves on its own schedule. The
 * two are routinely months apart, so "has the XR moved?" cannot answer "is our
 * checklist-derived data current?". build-backbone stamps in_checklist,
 * checklist_parent_id and checklist_name from this release, and those carry
 * user-facing claims with links to its pages, so a stale one shows the old
 * accepted name beside a link to the page that now disagrees.
 *
 * The resolved release is then PROBED, because the alias moving is not the same
 * event as the archive being built (see the header): for a few days each month
 * `3LR` names a release nothing can download. Answering with it anyway is what
 * failed the weekly sync twice — and the failure lands in phase 3, killing the
 * GBIF phases after it that had nothing to do with CoL moving. So when the newest
 * release has no archive we step back to the newest one that does, and the sync
 * proceeds on last month's overlay until the build catches up.
 *
 * The nice consequence: the release we step back to is usually the one already on
 * disk, so the sync sees an unmoved checklist and skips the 3.4GB rebuild entirely
 * rather than redoing it to land in the same place.
 *
 * Called before the download, so the sync can compare pins before committing to a
 * 2 GB fetch — and so the release it compares is the one run() will actually get.
