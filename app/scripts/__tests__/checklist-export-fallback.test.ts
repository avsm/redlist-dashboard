/**
 * Phase 3 surviving the monthly window where `3LR` names a release nobody can
 * download yet.
 *
 * ChecklistBank points `3LR` at a new curated release the day CoL publishes it,
 * but building that release's ColDP export is a separate job on its own schedule
 * — one day behind for COL26.8, three for COL26.7, and still nothing four days
 * after COL26.9, which failed the 2026-09-13 weekly sync on a bare 404. Phase 3
 * runs before the GBIF phases, so the abort took the whole sync with it over a
 * file CoL simply had not written yet.
 *
 * So resolveChecklistDataset() probes the archive and steps back to the newest
 * release that has one. These cover the stepping-back, the guards on how far it
 * may go and what it may land on, and that the download then follows the release
 * it settled on rather than re-following the alias.
