/**
 * Scope-narrowed taxa-summary / node-children-summary, computed LIVE via DuckDB
 * instead of precomputed at sync time (contrast with taxa-summary.json /
 * table1a-children-summaries.json / ssc-group-children-summaries.json, read by species-store.ts).
 *
 * A "scope" here is a WHERE fragment narrowing assessed.parquet to some slice of
 * species that the precomputed artifacts don't cover: currently a set of countries
 * (Country View) and/or a set of realms (Realm View). Both are stored the same way
 * — a semicolon-joined varchar column on assessed.parquet — so they build the same
 * shape of predicate and compose by AND (marine species in Indonesia).
 *
 * Precomputing one file per scope was rejected for countries (~150-200 of them): it
 * would multiply scripts/build-taxa-summary.ts's runtime ~200x, add a staleness
 * window, and can't compose with other simultaneous filters. Instead this queries the
 * same assessed.parquet species-duckdb.ts already serves /api/redlist/species from,
 * adding the scope predicate to filterToSql()'s taxonomy-node predicate — computed
 * only for the specific scope + node actually requested, not the whole tree upfront.
 * Realm has only three values and so would have been cheap to precompute, but rides
 * the same live path rather than adding a second mechanism for the same job.
 *
 * Deliberately omits GBIF (gbif_species_count, gbif_ne_species_count, ...) and
 * Catalogue of Life (col_described, col_ne) fields entirely — neither dataset has a
 * country OR a realm dimension, so there is no valid scoped value to report. (Realm
 * is doubly absent: `systems` is populated only for ASSESSED species — unassessed.parquet
 * has no realm column at all — so a "% of described species assessed" figure can't be
 * computed per realm even in principle. See the taxonomy-tree.ts comment on the fish
 * Red List Authorities for the same blocker.) Callers (the two API routes) must mark
 * their response as scoped so the client knows to hide those columns rather than
 * render a misleading 0/undefined.
